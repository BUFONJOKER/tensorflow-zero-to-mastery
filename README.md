## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is organized chapter-wise — each chapter contains Jupyter notebooks based on exercises, coding demos, and experiments I performed while learning:

* TensorFlow basics
* Neural networks
* Computer vision
* NLP
* Transfer learning
* Building models end-to-end
* And more!

My goal is to track learning progress and create a clean reference for future projects.
